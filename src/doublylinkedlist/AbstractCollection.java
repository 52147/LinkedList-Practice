/**
 * =¡@the AbstractCollection class =
 * 
 * - Before we implement the ArrayList class, observe that some of the methods
 *   in the Collection interface can be easily implemented in terms of other.
 *   - For instance,  
 *     - isEmpty is easily implemented by checking if the size is 0.
 *     - Rather that doing so in ArrayList, LinkedList, and all the other concrete implementations,
 *       it would be preferable to do this once and use inheritance to obtain isEmpty.
 *     
 * - We could even override isEmpty if it turns out that for some collections
 *   there is a faster way of performing isEmpty that computing the current size.
 * 
 * - However, we cannot implement isEmpty in the Collection interface;
 *   this can only be done in an abstract class.
 * - This will be the AbstractCollection class.
 * - To simplify implementations, programmers designing new Collections classes
 *   can extend the AbstractCollection class rather than
 *   Implementing the Collection interface.
 *   
 * - The Collections API also defines additional classes such as AbstractList,
 *   AbstractSequentialList, and AbstractSet.
 * - We have chosen not to implement those,
 *   in keeping with our intention of providing a simplified subset of the Collections API/
 * - If, for some reason, you are implementing your own collections and
 *   extending the Java Collections API, 
 *   you should extend the most specific abstract class.
 *     
 * - In the code below, we see implementations of isEmpty, clear, and add.
 * - The first 2 methods have straightforward implementations.
 * - Certainly the implementation of clear is usable,    
 *   since it removes all items in the collections,,
 *   but there might be more efficient ways of performing the clear,
 *   depending on the type of collection being manipulated.
 *  
 * - Thus this implementation of clear serves as a default, but it is likely to be overridden.
 * - There is no sensible way of providing a usable implementation for add.
 * - So the 2 alternatives are to make add abstract
 *   (which is clearly doable, since AbstractCollection is abstract)
 *   or to provide an implementation that throws a runtime exception.
 *   
 * - We have down the latter, which matches the behavior in java.util.
 *   (Further down the road, this decision also makes it easier to create the class
 *    needed to express the values of map).  
 * 
 *   contains()
 *   remove()
 * - provides default implementations of contains and remove.
 * - Both implementations use a sequential search, so they are not efficient,
 *   and need to be overridden by respectable implementations of the Set interface.                         
 *      
 * 
 *   Object toArray()
 *   AnyType toArray()
 *   - contains the implementations of the 2 toArray methods.
 *   - The zero-parameter toArray is fairly simple to implement.
 *   - The one-parameter toArray makes use of a feature of Java known as reflection
 *     to create an array object that matches the parameter type
 *     in the case that the parameter is not large enough to store the underlying collection.
 *
 * = StringBuilder =
 * 
 * - The code also shows a respectable linear-time implementation of toString,
 *   using a StringBuilder to avoid quadratic running time.
 *   (StringBuilder is slightly faster than StringBuffer;
 *     it is preferable for single-threaded applications).
 * 
 * - To see why StringBuilder is needed,
 *   consider the following code fragment that builds a String with N A's:
 *   
 *   String result = "";
 *   for(int i = 0; i< N ; i++)
 *       result += 'A';
 *       
 *     - While there is no doubt that this fragment works correctly
 *       because String objects are immutable,
 *       each call to result += 'A' is rewritten as result = result + 'A',
 *       and once we see that, it is apparent that each String concatenation 
 *       creates a new String object.
 *    
 *    - As we get further into the loop, these String objects become more expensive to create.
 *    - We can estimate the cost of the i th String concatenation to be i,
 *      so the total cost is
 *      1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N, or O(N^2).
 *      If N is 100000, it is simple to write the code and see that the running time is significant.
 *     
 *    -Yet a simple rewrite results in a linear-time algorithm that executes in the blink of the eye:
 *    
 *      char [] theChars = new char[N];
 *      
 *      for(int i = 0 ; i < N ; i++)
 *          theChars[i] = 'A';
 *      
 *      String result = new String(theChars);
 *      
 *      - The use of an array of characters works only if we know the final size of the String.
 *      - Otherwise, we have to use something like ArrayList<char>.
 *      
 *      - A StringBuilder is similar in concept to an ArrayList<char>,
 *        with array doubling but with method names that are specific for String operations.
 *        
 *      - Using a StringBuilder, the code looks like
 *      
 *        StirngBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
 *        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
 *            sb.append('A');
 *        String result = new String(sb);
 *        
 *        - This code is linear-time and runs quickly.
 *        
 *        - Some String concatenations, such as those in a single expression,
 *          are optimized by the compiler to avoid repeated creations of Strings.
 *        - But if your concatenations are intermingled with other statements,
 *          as is the case here, then you often can use a StringBuilder for more efficient code.
 *          
 *          - concatenations:
 *            the operation of joining 2 strings together. use + or concat().
