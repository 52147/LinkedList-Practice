 * = The List interface =
 * 
 * - The list is a collection of items in which the items have a position.
 * - The most obvious example of a list is an array.
 * - In an array, items are placed in position 0,1,etc.
 * 
 * - The List interface extends the Collection interface and abstracts the notion of a position.
 * - The interface in java.util adds numerous methods to the Collection interface.
 * - We are content to add the three methods in this program.
 * 
 *   get()
 *   set()
 *   iterator()
 * - The first 2 methods are get and set, which are similar to the methods that we have seen in ArrayList.
 * - The third method returns a more flexible iterator, the ListIterator.
 *
